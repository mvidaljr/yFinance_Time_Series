# Time Series Analysis with yFinance

## Project Overview

This project focuses on using the `yFinance` library to retrieve and analyze historical stock market data. The objective is to perform time series analysis, including data visualization and forecasting, to gain insights into stock price movements over time. This analysis can help in making informed decisions in stock trading and investment strategies.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Stock market data retrieved using the `yFinance` library.
- **Data:** Includes historical stock prices, trading volume, and other relevant financial indicators.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Data Retrieval:**
  - `yFinance` for downloading historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- **Data Analysis:**
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
- **Time Series Analysis:**
  - `Statsmodels` and `Scikit-learn` for time series modeling and forecasting.

## Methodology

### Data Retrieval:

- **Using yFinance:**
  - Retrieved historical stock data for selected companies, including open, high, low, close prices, and trading volume.

### Data Preprocessing:

- **Handling Missing Values:**
  - Managed missing data by forward filling or using interpolation techniques.
  
- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Created additional features such as moving averages, daily returns, and volatility to enhance the time series analysis.

### Time Series Analysis:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualized stock price trends over time and analyzed patterns like seasonality and trends.
  
- **Model Development:**
  - Applied time series models like ARIMA or exponential smoothing to forecast future stock prices.
  - Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

- **Example Usage:**
  ```python
  import yfinance as yf
  
  data = yf.download('AAPL', start='2020-01-01', end='2023-01-01')
  ```

## Results

The analysis provided insights into stock price trends and helped identify potential future price movements. The models built using time series analysis techniques showed a reasonable degree of accuracy in forecasting stock prices.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of time series analysis in understanding and predicting stock market behavior. By leveraging historical data, investors can make more informed decisions about buying and selling stocks.

## Future Work

- Experiment with more advanced time series models like LSTM or Prophet for improved forecasting.
- Expand the analysis to include a broader range of stocks and financial indicators.
- Develop a web app to provide real-time stock price forecasts using the models built in this project.
